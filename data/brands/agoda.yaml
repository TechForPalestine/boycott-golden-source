  Booking.com, whos parent company Booking Holdings owns Agoda, allows listings in occupied Palestinian territory, and after initially deciding to add a label to properties which are in occupied territory, reversed that move under pressure from Israel.[^1]

  Don't book on Agoda.
  Book directly with businesses. They usually offer discounts and similar terms for direct bookings.
  Don't list your services on Agoda.
  Don't work for Booking Holdings
