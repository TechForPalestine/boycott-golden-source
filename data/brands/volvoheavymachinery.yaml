status: avoid
description: |-
  Volvo heavy machinery has been used in the demolition of Palestinian neighbourhoods in Occupied Palestine, benefiting them commercially from the Israeli occupation. They issued a statement distancing themselves and rejecting responsibility for its sales networks decisions, however, it is still complicit unless it ends its relationship with the companies who sell equipment to the IDF, for example Mayers Cars and Trucks in Ashdod.[^1]

  Don't buy Volvo machinery.
  Don't sell Volvo machinery.
  Don't work for Volvo heavy machinery.
