description: |-
  The parent company of Eden Springs UK is an Israeli water company which steals water resources from the farmers and towns in the Golan Heights, restricting access to it for non Israelis. Eden Water around Europe sells locally sourced water, however, as its parent is complicit in illegal occupation, it should be boycotted.[^1]

  Don't buy Eden Springs products.
