description: |-
  NYX Professional is a brand owned by L'Oreal, which is a 'warm friend of Israel'. After sending a letter to the Arab League with information helping the boycott, they paid a $1.4m fine and issued an apology, before fostering a new relationship with Israel, with heavy investment and even operating a factory in Occupied Palestine.[^1]
