  Tesco is partnering with an Israeli start, Trigo Retail, up to deliver till-less stores with several already open in London. Michael Gabay, the CEO of Trigo is a staunch zionist.[^1]

  Don't buy Tesco products, especially from their GetGo stores.
  Pressure Tesco to drop their partnership with Trigo, and to choose a local partner instead.
