  Owned by **Unilever**.

  **Calippo** and Ben & Jerry's are owned by **Unilever**. When Ben & Jerry's decided to stop selling its products in Israel, **Unilever** sold off the Israeli distribution rights to Avi Zinger to circumvent their decision and to force Ben & Jerry's brand name to continue selling in Israel.[^1]
