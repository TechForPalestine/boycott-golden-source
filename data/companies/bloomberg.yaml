  **Bloomberg** personally donated $2 million, saying on Instagram: "In the wake of this weekend's appalling terrorist attacks on Israel, I'm stepping up my support for @Magen_David_Adom, the Israeli Red Cross." He said he would match any contributions to the organization, and in response, more than 9,000 donors gave $7.5 million. That amount was then matched by Bloomberg Philanthropies, Forbes reported.[^1]
